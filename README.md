# Superheroes API

## Overview

The Superheroes API is a RESTful web service that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of superheroes. The data is stored in a SQL Express Server database, and the API is documented using Swagger UI for easy exploration and testing.
